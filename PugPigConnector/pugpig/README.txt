PUGPIG HTML TEMPLATES



The three editions included have identical HTML but different navigation styles. 



The editions are;
 - scrolling in both orientations,
 - paning in both orientations,
 - paning in landscape and scrolling in portrait.


The editions contain a cover with links to article, section-indexes and two different styles of article. 


The editions can be accessed using the Pugpig Reader - http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/pugpig-reader/id487277383?mt=8



There are two kinds of feeds you can use to access the editions;

The first is using the editions-manifest.xml which refers to the index.manifest, which points to all the HTML files in the order they should 
appear.
The second id editions-atom.xml, which points to a more sophisticated atom feed, listing all the HTML file, information for the
 Pugpig table of contents and bookmarking links for sharing. 



More can be read about the xml feeds in the wiki - http://dev.pugpig.com/doku.php/start
